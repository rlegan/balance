Discord alternative to 42 (old) bot Slack bot called `La Balance`.

It sends a message with the old version and the new version of a recently modified message sent from a user (really annoying).

**HOW TO USE IT**

You can invite the bot via [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=745341978727940236&permissions=0&scope=bot) or clone this repo, copy `template.env` into `.env` and paste your Discord bot's token, then you can run it using `python3 srcs/main.py` ! Make sure you have `discord` and `dotenv` packages installed. :)
